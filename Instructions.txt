All pre-init setup should be done in preSet.sqf, which includes a list of strings to look for in your mod list should you want to change loadouts or mission functionality based on loaded mods.


The "mods"-directory includes mod-specific settings:

ASR settings can be modified to change AI behaviour if ASR AI is running

ACE settings can be modified to change ACE behaviour. If you can't find the setting you want, load up and set up your settings via ACE modules, and use ACE config export to get the variable names and values. 

TFAR settings can be used to determine various things about each side's radios, and to set up group ID specific radio channels and alternate channels for leaders

ACRE settings are kinda barebones right now. They will be expanded once I feel like it.


initServer.sqf includes a loop to monitor mission state and to end it once it is ready to end.

init.sqf runs only after initServer.sqf is finished, and includes primary mod settings loading for any mods that need it. It also includes a section for player-only stuff, where the briefing is launched and which you can use to add player event handlers, manipulating local triggers, and so on. It also runs hcHandle.sqf, which is currently a placeholder until I fix a couple of issues with my automatic Headless Client compatibility functionality.

onPlayerRespawn.sqf runs on a player spawning in. It runs the player gear script and radio setup should a radio mod be active.

end.sqf runs at mission end on every player (from initServer.sqf) and should be used for displaying the correct mission ending.

Put any mission-initial AI scripting in ai\init.sqf

Customise player gear in player\gear.sqf and AI gear in ai\gear.sqf
