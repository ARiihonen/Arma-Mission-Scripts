Team leaders can set up their team's starting position by clicking on an applicable map position while holding ALT. The position will be indicated by a new marker. If only one team starting position has been selected, both teams will start at that position.
<br /> <br />
Applicable starting positions are within <marker name = 'mrk_exampleOuter'>the blue Area of Operations circle marker</marker>, but outside of the <marker name = 'mrk_exampleInner'>red circle.</marker>
