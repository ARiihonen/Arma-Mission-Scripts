The majority of Altis has fallen into CSAT control. Numerous observation posts and checkpoints have been established, many of them in remote parts of the island. Several resistance groups continue hiding in the mountainous regions far from the frequently used routes and military outposts. These groups rely heavily on material support smuggled onto the island.
