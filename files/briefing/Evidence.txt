Anything that might have evidence in it will have a hold-action to search for and eliminate it. This action will not be removed once you complete it, and you will not get any notification for getting all of the evidence. You need to communicate, coordinate, and remember what you have checked. Whether you got the evidence you needed or not will be revealed at the end of the mission.
