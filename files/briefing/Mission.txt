Assault the former syndicate hideout %1, and <br />
- kill all the gendarmerie defending it <br />
- destroy all evidence they might be carrying <br />
- destroy all evidence the syndicate members killed defending the area might have <br />
- destroy all evidence on laptops or documents in the hideout <br />
<br /> <br />
When you are sure no evidence is left behind, leave the area to avoid inevitable gendarmerie reinforcements.
